% Level 4 and 5 headings on their own line in LaTeX

%% In LaTeX level 4 headings are rendered with the \paragraph command and level 5 headings are rendered with the \subparagraph command. These commands set the (first) paragraph after the heading run-in with the heading. There is an easy way to fix this. Make sure to include the following in your LaTeX preamble:

% Make "clones" of the commands
\let\originalparagraph\paragraph
\let\originalsubparagraph\subparagraph

% Redefine the commands using the "clones"
\renewcommand{\paragraph}[1]%
{\originalparagraph{#1}\hfill}
\renewcommand{\subparagraph}[1]%
{\originalsubparagraph{#1}\hfill}
